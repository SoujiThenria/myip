myip
====
myip is a client and server, to figure out your public IP address.

To build it just run: go build

To secure the connection between the cilent and server, as well as restrict
access, the communication is secured using mTLS.

Therefore you have to create a TLS certificate for the server and the client.
This can be done using openssl or the tools form smallstep (e.g. step).

Here is some hint how you can create self sign certificates for the
server/client. Password protected certificates are not supported.

step ca init

step certificate create localhost server.crt server.key --profile leaf \
--ca ../certs/root_ca.crt --ca-key ../secrets/root_ca_key \
--no-password --insecure
